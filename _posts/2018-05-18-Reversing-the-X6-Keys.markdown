### Introduction

This is a "Work in Progress"

### Notes
I am NOT a locksmith
I infact know NONE of the correct terminologies.
Therefor...
I will call the number of cuts..... the number of cuts....
I will call X axis as the long direction of the key, X1, X2 are the cut positions.
I will call Y axis as the cut depth/position, Y1, Y2, so on


### X6 / 15-Golf 
## Laser Cut Key
This seems to match, very closely to the metric profile for the Golf in InstaCode
